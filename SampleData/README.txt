These are example x and y variables from an anonymized dataset. The x variables are DXA measurements
(as raw as we get them... unsure of any upstream processing), and the y variables are MRI
measurements. As example tasks, predict any/all of the y variables using the x ones. The varibles
named *_agg are aggregate variables produced from the * variables (eg) means, sums, ratios), so perhaps
they shouldn't be included in models directly with their constituents, or things might get confusing.
